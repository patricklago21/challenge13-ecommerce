# Challenge 13: E-commerce Backend

This project was built to simulate the backend of an e-commerce website. As the user, you can get, add, update, and delete all the products, categories, and tags present in the database. This project does not include a frontend and must be deployed in the terminal using "npm start". This also utilizes four other npm packages: dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize.
